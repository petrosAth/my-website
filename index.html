        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Petros, a seasoned professional with a background in graphic design who has transitioned into the
          dynamic world of software development. I'm passionate about crafting digital solutions that combine aesthetics
          and functionality to deliver exceptional user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have several years of experience in graphic design, working on various projects for clients in different
          industries. This experience has allowed me to develop a keen eye for detail, a strong understanding of user
          experience and interface design and a good sense of color theory and typography. In recent years, I've
          embarked on an exciting path of self-discovery and growth. During this time, I've actively immersed myself in
          the realm of software development, expanding my skill set to encompass languages such as C, Python, and Lua.
          Furthermore, I've delved into the captivating world of web development, practicing on languages like HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me seeking inspiration from various sources, whether it's
          experimenting with new coding challenges, staying updated on software engineering best practices, or taking in
          the latest design and development trends.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm thrilled to continue my journey in web and software development, and I'm always eager to explore new
          opportunities and collaborations. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you'd like to discuss potential
          projects or collaborations.
        </p>
